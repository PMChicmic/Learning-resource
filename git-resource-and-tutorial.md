# Git Overview And Resource links

##### Git
[Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Git-Basics) is a version control system, which is define our application version. There is two types of version control system, `Centralized` and `Distributed` version control system.

It's allow multiple user to work together and trake each developer work and update the other developers.
