# MongoDB
`MongoDB` is a `simple, dynamic` and `scalable NoSQL database`. It contains NoSql `document store models` to store data in the form of separate `Javascript Object Notation` (JSON) or `Binary JSON` (BSON). It is more flexible than Relational Database. Each data model called collection in which data get stored.
Actual scope of the MongoDB is to implement a data store that provides `high performance, high availability, automatic scaling, high flexibility`.

___Note: Generally MongoDB is supported in Windows, Linux, Mac OS X.___

- MongoDB Storage Engine
  - The storage engine is the component of the database that is responsible for managing how data is stored, both in memory and on disk. MongoDB supports multiple storage engines, as different engines perform better for specific workloads. Choosing the appropriate storage engine for your use case can significantly impact the performance of your applications.

Some of Storage Engines are:
   - WiredTiger Storage Engine (Default) [Learn More...](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/storage-engines/)
   - In-Memory Storage Engine [Learn More...](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/storage-engines/)
   - MMAPv1 Storage Engine (Deprecated as of MongoDB 4.0) [Learn More...](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/storage-engines/)
